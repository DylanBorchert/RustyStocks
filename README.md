# What is Rusty Stocks

This is a simple stock market data analysis and prediction tool. The main purpose is have an to populate your database with stock data and then run some analysis on it. The plan is once the data side of the project is complete, I will move on to the prediction side of the project. The prediction side will use machine learning to understand the data.

# Why Rust?

I am using Rust because its fast and predictable, and it will be handling a lot of data. when it comes to building a ML model to predict stock prices, I want to be able to run the model on a lot of data quickly. Most importantly I want learn Rust and this project will be a good way to do that.

# The Plan

The part of the project is in very early stages but will be the back bone of the project. Once the data side of the project is complete, I will move to a nextjs frontend to display the data in an invative way.
